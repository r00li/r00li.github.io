                <p class="text-faded">My name is Andrej Rolih. I am an iOS developer from Ljubljana, Slovenia. Currently working at <a style="color: white;" href="http://kamino.si/">Kamino</a>, where we make awesome mobile applications for both Android and iOS.</p>
                <p class="text-faded">When I am not at work I usually tinker around on one of my side projects. These are usually crazy (and not so crazy) hardware projects - often to do with microcontrollers (ARM - STM and Nordic), clocks, home automation, 3D Printing and CNC, drones and other RC, and much more. I also collect and restore retro computers and consoles from 70s to early 2000s. A small collection of my more interesting projects (that I actually documented) is listed below.</p>
